<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's trajectory shows an initial misinterpretation where a new app was built instead of extending the existing Deutsche Fahrschul-App. After correction, the engineer successfully imported the existing GitHub codebase. Significant work was done on the original app, including dynamic practice hour management (add/remove, unlimited), German date formatting, separating Fahrerassistenzsysteme into its own category, and implementing a weighted progress bar. However, these changes consistently failed to deploy to the user's browser, despite working in the preview. This led to a pivot: the user requested a local iOS tablet PWA. The engineer then created a single HTML-based PWA, but the latest user feedback indicates it's missing the kompletter Ausbildungsbaum. The primary unresolved meta-issue is the deployment problem with the original full-stack application.

The user initially requested implementing Hinzufügen/Entfernen-Funktionalität für Übungsfahrten in der DetailView (add/remove practice hours in the DetailView) for an existing German driving school app (https://fahrschul-trainer.preview.emergentagent.com), allowing unlimited whole (1h) and half (0.5h) hours.
After an initial misinterpretation where a new app was created, the user clarified the need to extend the *existing* app, providing a GitHub repository.
Subsequent requests included:
1.  Redesigning the UI for adding/removing practice hours to use circular + buttons and × icons on hover for deletion, replacing the 5/5 counter.
2.  Formatting all dates (birth date, theory exam, practical exam, start date) to German format (DD.MM.YYYY).
3.  Extracting FAHRERASSISTENZSYSTEME from Situative Bausteine and presenting it as a separate, blue-colored category between Situative Bausteine and Beim Fahrer.
4.  Adjusting the progress bar calculation to a weighted system: '/' (once) as the smallest weight (25%), '×' (twice) as medium (60%), and '⊗' (thrice) as the largest weight (100%), with empty being 0%.
Due to persistent deployment issues preventing these features from appearing in the user's browser, the user then requested to transform the application into a functional, offline iOS tablet app using internal storage.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend framework for the original and tablet applications.
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for the original application.
- **MongoDB**: Database for the original application, accessed via .
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: The architecture chosen for the local iOS tablet app.
- **LocalStorage/IndexedDB**: Used for local data persistence in the PWA.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework used across both applications.
- **Supervisor**: Manages backend (Python) and frontend (Node.js) processes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:


- **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application.
  - **Importance**: Defines API endpoints, data models (e.g., Student, PracticeHour), and handles database interactions.
  - **Changes**: Modified  model to use dynamic lists for  and  instead of fixed-size arrays. New API endpoints were added/modified for dynamic practice hour management (POST/DELETE ). Logic for  was modified to move Fahrerassistenzsysteme into its own category (though this change was later reverted to a frontend-only solution due to deployment issues). Weighted progress calculation logic was implemented in .

- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component.
  - **Importance**: The entry point for the main application's UI, handling routing and global state.
  - **Changes**: Modified initially to a new application structure, then reverted and adapted to render the StudentList and StudentDetail components of the imported GitHub app.

- **/app/frontend/src/components/StudentDetail.js**: Displays detailed information for a selected student.
  - **Importance**: Critical for student-specific data display, including practice hours and training sections.
  - **Changes**:
    - Implemented UI for adding/removing practice hours with + circles and × on hover.
    - Integrated  for , , , and .
    - Modified rendering logic for Fahrerassistenzsysteme to visually separate it from Situative Bausteine as a distinct blue category using frontend filtering.
    - Conditional rendering for + buttons was adjusted to ensure they are always visible.

- **/app/frontend/src/components/TrainingSection.js**: Renders individual training categories and their progress.
  - **Importance**: Dynamically displays training content based on backend data.
  - **Changes**: No direct code changes found in the trajectory, but its rendering output is affected by backend changes (for Fahrerassistenzsysteme) and frontend filtering in .

- **/app/backend/server.py** (again for progress calculation):
  - **Importance**: Responsible for calculating the progress percentage for training sections.
  - **Changes**: Implemented weighted calculation logic:  (/) = 25%,  (×) = 60%,  (⊗) = 100%.

- **/app/fahrschul-ios-final/fahrschul-app.html**: The standalone HTML file for the iOS PWA.
  - **Importance**: This single file encapsulates the entire application, designed to be offline-capable and installed on an iOS device. It directly embeds all React, CSS, and data.
  - **Changes**: This file was generated to include all the features developed (dynamic practice hours, German dates, separate Fahrerassistenzsysteme via frontend logic, weighted progress bar) for the original app, effectively bypassing the deployment issues by creating a self-contained, client-side application.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Deployment Issue Resolution**: The core problem of the original full-stack application's changes not deploying correctly to the  URL remains unresolved.
- **Complete Ausbildungsbaum in PWA**: The currently generated PWA () does not include the complete training structure (Grundstufe, Aufbaustufe, etc.).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with creating a functional iOS tablet application that works offline and uses internal storage, incorporating all previously developed features from the original app. This was done as a workaround for the persistent deployment issues of the main application.

The engineer generated a single HTML file, , which is intended to be a standalone PWA. This file contains the UI and logic for student management, including the dynamic practice hour addition/removal, German date formats, the frontend-filtered Fahrerassistenzsysteme category, and the weighted progress bar. The application is designed to function offline using LocalStorage for data persistence and can be added to the iOS homescreen.

The user's most recent feedback indicates that this generated  is incomplete, specifically stating, da fehlt der komplette ausbildungsbaum mit der grundstufe aufbaustufe usw.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to integrate the complete Ausbildungsbaum (training structure) into the generated iOS PWA ().
